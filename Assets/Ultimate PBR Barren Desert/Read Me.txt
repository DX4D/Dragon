NOTE: Due to possible compatibility issues with unity versions, I was not allowed to include the image effects in this package.
Due to this, what you see in unity may not look exactly like you saw in the screenshots. 
However, this can be easily fixed by importing the proper image effects, and adding them to the camera yourselves.
If you are on Unity 5.5.0 or above, I suggest downloading and working with the new post processing stack, found here: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/wiki.
If you on a version before Unity 5.5.0, then I would suggest the following. Go into your project, Assets tab at the top, Import Package > Effects. 
Doing this will get you the image effects required to replicate the exact screenshots, or if you are using Unity 5.5.0, potentially better looking effects than the screenshots.
If you need any assistance with the image effects, then feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you out.
